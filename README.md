Tetrix (a combination of the words Tetris and RGB Matrix) is a FPGA implementation of the classic Tetris real time strategy puzzle arcade game, designed to support up to 4 players, and output to both vga and an 32x64 RGB matrix. Our project runs on the Xilinx NEXYS A7 FPGA, and our Adafruit RGB Matrix is driven by an Arduino Uno. The communication between the FPGA and Arduino is performed via serial UART port.

Currently, the project has varying functionality
